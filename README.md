## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

EduPath is a decoupled web application:
*   **Frontend:** A React.js single-page application (SPA) that handles the user interface.
*   **Backend:** A Django REST Framework (DRF) API that handles business logic, data, and AI processing.
*   **Communication:** The frontend and backend interact via RESTful HTTP requests (JSON).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18 or higher) & npm
*   Python (v3.10 or higher) & pip
*   PostgreSQL

### Installation & Development

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/edupath.git
    cd edupath
    ```

2.  **Backend (Django) Setup:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Create a virtual environment and activate it
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install Python dependencies
